This is a system for analysing and quantifying survey responses from FeedbackArmy.com

I have released this code as part of a project I undertook to experiment with
A/B testing website copy before engaging in a visual design process.

You can read all about the project here:

1. Unzip in your web root
2. Import feedback.sql into a new database
3. Set your database details in connect.php
4. Copy and paste your feedback army results into separate text files in the fb_army directory
5. Edit import_fb_army.php to define your questions and different URLs/file names
6. Run import_fb_army.php either from the command line or by pointing a browser at it, you only need to do this once
4. Point a browser at unformatted.php to get started
